                    <p className=' md:text-lg md:max-w-lg lg:text-2xl lg:max-w-2xl'>The rise of the NNNedlog brand is quite interesting.
                        NNNedlog was born in 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown period. <br /><br />
                        It was started all because a friend introduced me to a mobile drawing app - Adobe Illustrator Draw. <br /><br />
                        This was a game-changer, since I didnâ€™t know apps like these existed, and so I began making simple vector illustrations. <br /><br />
                        <span className='font-bold text-textBoldBlue'> This was my first vector illustration I made on Adobe Illustrator on my Infinix Hot 7 Pro.</span> <br /><br />
                        Back then, I named my brand Adobe Draw with Golden.

                    <p className=' md:text-lg md:max-w-lg md:text-right lg:text-right lg:text-2xl lg:max-w-2xl'>Years after, and Adobe Draw with Golden has been changed to NNNedlog. <br /><br />
                        With added services like NFT art, merch design and more, NNNedlog is better suited to serve your art needs. <br /><br />
